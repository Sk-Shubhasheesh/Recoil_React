                     # Recoil Learing üòç

### What is Recoil ?
‚û° Recoil js is another state management library for React.
‚û° Though we already have Redux. Mobx, Context, but here we got a new light entry in the community.

### Why Recoil ?
üü† Firstly, it solves the global state management problems.
üü† Easy to learn; there are no new major principles n logic to learn.
üü† Quite Simple, it is similar like react.
Though I like redux, but it will not take that much time to learn.

## Recoil concepts
‚û° There are two major concepts:
     1Ô∏è‚É£ Atoms
     2Ô∏è‚É£ Selectors

### Atoms
‚û° This is similar to how we use the useState hook in react.

#### 1. Let's start with binding root app with Recoil
```.js
import { RecoilRoot } from "recoil";
function App() {
  return <RecoilRoot>
    <MainApp />
  </RecoilRoot>
 
}
export default App

```

#### 2. Set the Atom
‚û° Recoil calls this part as atom, where we set the global key, value. It semilar to useState()
```.js
import {atom} from "recoil"

export const networkAtom = atom({
    key: "networkAtom",
    default: 102
})
export const jobsAtom = atom({
    key: "jobsAtom",
    default: 0
})
```
#### 3. use the atom - useRecoilState
Returns a tuple where the first element is the value of state and the second element is a setter function that will update the value of the given state when called.
```.js
import { useRecoilState } from 'recoil'
const [messagingCount, setMessagingCount] = useRecoilState(messagingAtom)
```




### What is use useRecoilValue ?
‚è© Returns the value of the given Recoil state.
```.js
import {useRecoilValue } from 'recoil'
const networknotificationCount = useRecoilValue(networkAtom) 
const jobCount = useRecoilValue(jobsAtom) 
const notificationCount = useRecoilValue(notificationAtom)
```

### What is useSetRecoilState ?
‚è© If only you need to update something and not want to the value of it then we can use useSetRecoilState.
```.js
function ButtonUpdater(){
  const setMessagingCount = useSetRecoilState(messagingAtom)
  return(
    <button onClick={()=>setMessagingCount(c => c+1)}>Me </button>
    
  )
}

```
